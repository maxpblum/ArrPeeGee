# ArrPeeGee

The beginnings of an RPG framework. Mostly just an array of rooms, door and walls.

To try it, just run `python test_moving.py` in the console. You'll see an array of rooms depicted, with walls and doorways, some open and some closed. To move around, enter `u` for up, `d` for down, `l` for left, or `r` for right, or `q` for quit. The number at the bottom of the screen represents your health, which does nothing!

The board is generated randomly at the start, and so sometimes you may not have any valid path available to you.
